## Info

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

In this project, we worked on a social media app using Rails. The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements we must meet.

The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails 5.3.2
- Html
- CSS
- SCSS
- Bootstrap

# Special Gems

- Devise gem is used for User Model. [Devise Github](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- For Signing in with facebook we used Omniauth gem. [OmniAuth Github](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-github)

### ✨ [Live Demo](https://rails-facebook.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

> To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

> after that run the server from terminal in the root directory of the project

```
$ rails server
```

> Open `http://localhost:3000/` using your favourite broswer.

> you can now open the localhost, sign up and create posts and comment on them. It is also
> possible to like and unlike the posts. Lastly, you can be friends with other users.

> Or you can directly go to --> [Heroku Link](https://rails-facebook.herokuapp.com/) and try the app.
