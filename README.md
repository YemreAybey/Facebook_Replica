## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

after that run the server from terminal in the root directory of the project

```
$ rails server
```
you can now open the localhost, sign up and create posts and comment on them. It is also 
possible to like and unlike the posts. Lastly, you can be friends with other users.

Or you can directly go to --> [Heroku Link](https://rails-facebook.herokuapp.com/) and try the app.
